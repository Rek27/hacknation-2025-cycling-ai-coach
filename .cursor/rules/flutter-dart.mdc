## Flutter/Dart (Frontend)

- **Purpose**: Client UI built with Flutter. Communicates with the backend via HTTP and with Supabase for auth and database access.
- **Entry point**: [lib/main.dart](/lib/main.dart)
- **Folder layout**: Place feature code under `lib/src/`.

### Integrations
- **Backend API (FastAPI)**
  - Local base URL during development: `http://localhost:8001`
  - Prefer creating a lightweight API client or helpers under `lib/src/`.

- **Supabase (Auth + PostgreSQL)**
  - Use Supabase Flutter SDK for sign-in/out and session handling.
  - All PostgreSQL access must go through deployed SQL functions (RPC). Do not query tables directly from the client.
  - SQL functions live in [`database_functions/`](/database_functions/)

### Notes
- Propagate auth context when calling the backend if endpoints require authentication.
- Keep UI logic and network/data logic separated for maintainability.
